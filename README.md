## Info
- GUI stands for general user interface.
- Configuration & utility program for [P.I.G.S](https://github.com/Fusion-Lightguns/P.I.G.S--Pico-Infared-Gun-System) LightGun ecosystem.
- Orginally forked from SeongGinos [GUN4ALL GUI](https://github.com/SeongGino/GUN4ALL-GUI). Much like P.I.G.S itself I likled GUI but wanted different so here we are .
